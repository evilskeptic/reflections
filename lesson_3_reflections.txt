When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
So others could access it, or I could access it from another machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
To allow for the flexibility of others to work on the project without their work being pushed forcefully on top of mine.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A fork is used to clone one github repository to another, within github.  A clone can be used to clone any repository.  A branch is a different path in a single repository. Use the fork or clone to get a copy of someone else's work without affecting it.  Use a branch to just create a new version of an existing repository which you might want to remerge later.
