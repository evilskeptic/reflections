What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You have to start somewhere!  It records the starting state of the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area to hold files I intend to commit. It's value
should be that I can do a partial commit of files in a logical change, while leaving
others behind that perhaps I don't want to include yet for some reason.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
By only placing the files into the staging area that make sense for the change, while
leaving other currently edited files in the working directory.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If I wanted to create different versions of my code while keeping a master version intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

They let me see what changes are where within the structure, and also easily see if
there are any nodes not connected to a parent.
