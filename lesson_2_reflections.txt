What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

You have to start somewhere!  It records the starting state of the directory.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a temporary area to hold files I intend to commit. It's value
should be that I can do a partial commit of files in a logical change, while leaving
others behind that perhaps I don't want to include yet for some reason.
